A Controller (in this context, an implementation of HttpServlet) may perform either a forward or
a redirect operation at the end of processing a request. It's important to understand the
difference between these two cases, in particular with respect to browser reloads of web pages.

Forward

    a forward is performed internally by the servlet
    the browser is completely unaware that it has taken place, so its original URL remains intact
    any browser reload of the resulting page will simple repeat the original request, with the
    original URL

Redirect

    a redirect is a two step process, where the web application instructs the browser to fetch a
    second URL, which differs from the original
    a browser reload of the second URL will not repeat the original request, but will rather fetch
    the second URL
    redirect is marginally slower than a forward, since it requires two browser requests, not one
    objects placed in the original request scope are not available to the second request

In general, a forward should be used if the operation can be safely repeated upon a browser
reload of the resulting web page; otherwise, redirect must be used. Typically, if the operation
performs an edit on the datastore, then a redirect, not a forward, is required. This is simply
to avoid the possibility of inadvertently duplicating an edit to the database.
