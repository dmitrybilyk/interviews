The life cycle of the servlet is managed by a web container the application is running in.
Firstly, servlet is created if it is not created yet.
Then initialization phase is taking place.
Constructor runs. Method init runs.

Then servlet proceeds requests.

In 'service' method container decides to which method to go.

There are several methods to work with different types of requests:

- GET
- POST
- PUT
- HEAD
- OPTIONS
- TRACE

Eventually 'destroy' method is taking place when server is shutting down.
