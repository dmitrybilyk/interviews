Global variables - they a available to window object.
If we want that function execute while page loads we have to
wrap it in '( )' (pars).
You may use custom attribute in html. it should start with
'data-'. Then we may use this value. In jquery - with .data( method.
We may ignore 'data-' in parantheties.
siblings('button') - we get all the buttons that are on the same level.

.end() - we use this method if we want to go back on 1 level in the chang of
objects.


The better way - to use on method with ('click') param (for example). Because
eventually 'on' method is called by jQuery. The same for bind method.

When we use click we add eventHandler to all objects of the dom. The best way -
to use live method if we want to clone element (appendTo). It only checks that
'h2' element is clicked (if live('h2')) and then copies this element to dom.
In this way eventHandler - the part of the document (not h2).

If you work with element you use after - to append after. If you create the element-
use insertAfter() method.


if we use function name with '()' then function will be called emmidietly.
Otherwise, it will not.

EveryThing in javascript is an object - even functions. They have fields and
methods.

We may use ~~true to return 1... ~~false - to return 0


all methods - load, getJSON, get, post - eventually call JQUERY.ajax().

serialize method helps us to form name-value pairs from form inputs!!!
