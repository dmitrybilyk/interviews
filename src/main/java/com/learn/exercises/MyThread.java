//If a Runnable object is passed to the Thread constructor, then the run method of the Thread
// class will invoke the run method of the Runnable object.

//        In this case, however, the run method in the Thread class is overridden by the run
// method in MyThread class. Therefore the run() method in MyRunnable is never invoked.

//        Both times, the run() method in MyThread is invoked instead.
