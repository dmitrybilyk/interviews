Single table:

- Data not normalized;
- Constraints not null could not be applied;
- We use simple select using discriminator;
- To insert or update we use single insert or update;

Table per subclass class (joined strategy):

- Normalized;
- Not null could be applied;
- Joins among table. For example fetching FourWheeler will require a join on FourWheeler and Vehicle table.
If all user needs to be fetched than it will put a join for all three tables

Table per each concrete class:
- One table for each concrete class.
- Not maintainable.
- Change in base class leads to changes in all tables of derived class.
- to retreive data we use Separate Select or Union Select.
- One insert or update for each subclass.
