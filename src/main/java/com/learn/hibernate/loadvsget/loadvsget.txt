load will return a proxy object.

get will return an actual object, and returns null if it wont find any object.


The one difference between get() and load() is how they indicate that the
instance could not be found. If no row with the given identifier value
exists in the database, get() returns null. The load() method throws an
ObjectNotFoundException. It’s your choice what error-handling you prefer.

More important, the load() method may return a proxy, a placeholder,
without hitting the database. A consequence of this is that you may get
an ObjectNotFoundException later, as soon as you try to access the
returned placeholder and force its initialization (this is also called
lazy loading; we discuss load optimization in later chapters.) The load()
 method always tries to return a proxy, and only returns an initialized
 object instance if it’s already managed by the current persistence
 context. In the example shown earlier, no database hit occurs at all!
 The get() method on the other hand never returns a proxy, it always
 hits the database.

You may ask why this option is useful—after all, you retrieve an object
to access it. It’s common to obtain a persistent instance to assign it as
a reference to another instance. For example, imagine that you need the
item only for a single purpose: to set an association with a Comment:
aComment.setForAuction(item). If this is all you plan to do with the
item, a proxy will do fine; there is no need to hit the database. In
other words, when the Comment is saved, you need the foreign key value
of an item inserted into the COMMENT table. The proxy of an Item provides
just that: an identifier value wrapped in a placeholder that looks like
the real thing.

use load only if you are sure that record does exist in DB. In that case
it is harmless to work with the proxy and will be helpful delaying DB
query till the mapped property is actually needed.
