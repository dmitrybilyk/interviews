INNER JOIN: Returns all rows when there is at least one match in BOTH tables    (the same as join)
LEFT JOIN: Return all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table
RIGHT JOIN: Return all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table   (In some databases RIGHT JOIN is called RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
FULL JOIN: Return all rows when there is a match in ONE of the tables
