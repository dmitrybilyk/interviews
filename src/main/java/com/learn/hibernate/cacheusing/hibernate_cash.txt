Hibernate Cache Types

Hibernate uses different types of caches. Each type of cache is used for different purposes. Let us first have a
look at these cache types.

    The first cache type is the session cache. The session cache caches object within the current session.
    The second cache type is the query Cache. The query cache is responsible for caching queries and their results.
    The third cache type is the second level cache. The second level cache is responsible for caching objects across sessions.
