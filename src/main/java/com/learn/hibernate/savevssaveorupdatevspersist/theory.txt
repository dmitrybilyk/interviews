Main difference between save and saveOrUpdate method is that save() generates a new identifier and INSERT record into database
while saveOrUpdate can either INSERT or UPDATE based upon existence of record.

Save vs Persist

1. Save returns id - persist returns an object
2. Both make transient object persistent but persist doesn't guarantee the id assignment at once. This could be happen at
flush time
3. persist() will not execute INSERT outside the session. but save() could do this. This  is why persist() is useful in
extended session context.
