    saveOrUpdate() does the following:

        if the object is already persistent in this session, do nothing
        if another object associated with the session has the same identifier, throw an exception
        if the object has no identifier property, save() it
        if the object's identifier has the value assigned to a newly instantiated object, save() it
        if the object is versioned by a <version> or <timestamp>, and the version property value is the same value assigned to a newly instantiated object, save() it
        otherwise update() the object
