ArrayList - Based on array of Object type. Every element has an index.
Default 'add(E e)' method will add to the end of list. If we insert or remove in the middle
then new array will be created underneath. Also the new array will be created if capacity is full.

LinkedList consists of Nodes. Every node consists of element (value), link to previous and to next element.

Get (search) will be fast on ArrayList - o(1) - constant. On LinkedList get is o(n) in the middle as it needs to
iterate via all elements (from end or from start, depends on target index value).
Removal in ArrayList is constant just for the case of last element as it doesn't need to re-index other elements.
LinkedList will search with constant time for first or last elements.

Deletion for ArrayList is constant just for the last element as it doesn't need to re-index elements.
LinkedList is linear for the middle element and constant for first and last.

LinkedList is preferable just in case if you need to often insert or delete on first or last element.
ArrayList is more convenient for processor regarding it's caches.
