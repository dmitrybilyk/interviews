List:
1. ArrayList - Based on array of Object type. Every element has an index.
Default 'add(E e)' method will add to the end of list. If we insert or remove in the middle
then new array will be created underneath. Also the new array will be created if capacity is full.

2. LinkedList consists of Nodes. Every node consists of element (value), link to previous and to next element.

Get (search) will be fast on ArrayList - o(1) - constant. On LinkedList get is o(n) in the middle as it needs to
iterate via all elements (from end or from start, depends on target index value).
Removal in ArrayList is constant just for the case of last element as it doesn't need to re-index other elements.
LinkedList will search with constant time for first or last elements.

Deletion for ArrayList is constant just for the last element as it doesn't need to re-index elements.
LinkedList is linear for the middle element and constant for first and last.

LinkedList is preferable just in case if you need to often insert or delete on first or last element.
ArrayList is more convenient for processor regarding it's caches.

3. Stack extends Vector and behaves like LIFO. It has methods push and pop, peek.
4. Queue behaves like FIFO.
5. Deque behaves like FIFO but could be bidirectional (popLast, pushFirst etc.)

Map:
1. HashMap. There is a Entry interface in Map interface. Node from HashMap is an implementor of it.
Inside HashMap there is an array of type Node - Node[]. To determine to which node to put the value
hashing is used. This means index to where to put Node is calculated based on hash value (hashcode of key is used here)
and size of array.
If there is a collision (hash and key are different but index is the same) then Entries (Nodes) are persisted as a
linked list (every element has link to the next element of the bucket). If hash and key is the same then value is just
replaced. The better hashcode and equals are implemented the more evenly elements will be placed to nodes - less
collisions > better performance. If collision happens new elements are added to the beginning of the linked list.
Default size of Node[] is 16 and increase capacity is 0.75. If capacity is full then size is two times increased and indexes
of all elements are recalculated.
If we add a lot of elements to HashMap and at once remove them the size of map will not be decreased to initial value.
(ArrayList has method 'trimToSize()' for such cases). The only thing we can do is to created new map and send current as
a parameter.

2. Hashtable - obsolete. It's like HasmMap but with sinchronized methods.
3. TreeMap (implements SortedMap and Navi..Map) - keeps natural order of keys.
4. LinkedHashMap - keeps order (by keys) of insertion (or fetching) of elements

Set:
1.HashSet. Supports elements uniqueness. There is HashMap inside but as Value some dummy object is used.
2. TreeSet - keeps natural order of elements. (Comparator could be used manually)
3. LinkedHashSet - keeps order of insertion


Fail-fast collection (like ArrayList) will throw a ConcurrentModificationException exception if we remove element while we iterating it.
But it will not fail if we remove element on iterator object itself.
Fail-safe collection (like CopyOnWriteArrayList) will work with snapshot of original collection inside so it will
not throw an exception (but it takes more memory and state of collection is not uptodate while iteration).
