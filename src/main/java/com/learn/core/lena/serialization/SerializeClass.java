package com.learn.core.lena.serialization;

//   To serialize an object means to convert its state to a byte stream
// so that the byte stream can be reverted back into a copy of the object.
//   A Java object is serializable if its class or any of its superclasses implements
// either the java.io.Serializable interface or its subinterface, java.io.Externalizable.
//   Deserialization is the process of converting the serialized form of an object back into a copy of the object.
