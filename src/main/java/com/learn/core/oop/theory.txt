There are 4 basic principles of object oriented programming.
1. Encapsulation - Implementation or fields should be hidden from outside and some access method should be
provided to access them. In this way for instance state of the object could be secured.
2. Abstraction - If 2 objects are incorporate to each other then ideally they should know anything about internal
implementation of each other and should work via interfaces.
3. Inheritance - This principle describes 'IS-A' relationship between objects. One object could inherit the behavior
of another. This allows to not have duplicate code and to easiely support the code etc.
4. Polymorphism - one name > many forms. One interface > many implementations. Static - overloaded methods,
Dynamic - overridden methods - when JVM decides at runtime which behavior to run depending of implementation type.
