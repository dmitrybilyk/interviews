The Java Naming and Directory Interface™ (JNDI) is an application programming interface (API) that provides
naming and directory functionality to applications written using the Java™ programming language. It is
defined to be independent of any specific directory service implementation. Thus a variety of directories -new,
emerging, and already deployed can be accessed in a common way.

Architecture

The JNDI architecture consists of an API and a service provider interface (SPI). Java applications use the
JNDI API to access a variety of naming and directory services. The SPI enables a variety of naming and
directory services to be plugged in transparently, thereby allowing the Java application using the JNDI
API to access their services


Packaging

JNDI is included in the Java SE Platform. To use the JNDI, you must have the JNDI classes and one or more
service providers. The JDK includes service providers for the following naming/directory services:

    Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
    Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) Common Object Services (COS) name service
    Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) Registry
    Domain Name Service (DNS)
