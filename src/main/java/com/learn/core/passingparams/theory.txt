Primitives and Objects in Java are passed by Value.
In case of primitives the copy of values are created and in case of objects the new reference to the same
object is created. So if you change the object (values of it's fields) in method these changes will be visible
outside the method after it completes execution. But if you assign some new object to the object parameter
reference then original object will not be affected at all.
