Some IO improvements known to me are:

Files.list(Path dir) that returns a lazily populated Stream, the elements of which are the entries in the directory.
Files.lines(Path path) that reads all lines from a file as a Stream.
Files.find() that returns a Stream that is lazily populated with Path by searching for files in a file tree rooted at a given starting file.
BufferedReader.lines() that return a Stream, the elements of which are lines read from this BufferedReader.
