We have already seen forEach() method and Stream API for collections. Some new methods added in Collection API are:

Iterator default method forEachRemaining(Consumer action) to perform the given action for each remaining element until all elements have been processed or the action throws an exception.
Collection default method removeIf(Predicate filter) to remove all of the elements of this collection that satisfy the given predicate.
Collection spliterator() method returning Spliterator instance that can be used to traverse elements sequentially or parallel.
Map replaceAll(), compute(), merge() methods.
Performance Improvement for HashMap class with Key Collisions
