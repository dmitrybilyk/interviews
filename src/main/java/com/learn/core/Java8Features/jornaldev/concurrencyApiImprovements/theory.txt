Some important concurrent API enhancements are:

ConcurrentHashMap compute(), forEach(), forEachEntry(), forEachKey(), forEachValue(), merge(), reduce() and search() methods.
CompletableFuture that may be explicitly completed (setting its value and status).
Executors newWorkStealingPool() method to create a work-stealing thread pool using all available processors as its target parallelism level.
