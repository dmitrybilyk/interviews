//             The call to sleep causes the thread to wait for 100 milliseconds
// (1/10 of a second) after each iteration of the loop. However, this code is not
// quite correct: the sleep method can throw an InterruptedException, and a
// thread's run method is not allowed to throw any exceptions (because Thread.run,
// which is being overridden, throws no exceptions). Therefore, we must add code to
// catch that exception:
            try {
