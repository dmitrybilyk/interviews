What is difference between Comparable and Comparator interface?

Comparable and Comparator interfaces are used to sort collection or array of objects.Comparable interface is
used to provide the natural sorting of objects and we can use it to provide sorting based on single logic.
Comparator interface is used to provide different algorithms for sorting and we can chose the comparator we
want to use to sort the given collection of objects.


While passing a Collection as argument to a function, how can we make sure the function will not be able to modify it?

We can create a read-only collection using Collections.unmodifiableCollection(Collection c) method before passing it
as argument, this will make sure that any operation to change the collection will throw UnsupportedOperationException.


How can we create a synchronized collection from given collection?

We can use Collections.synchronizedCollection(Collection c) to get a synchronized (thread-safe) collection backed by
the specified collection.
