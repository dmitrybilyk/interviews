//we know that multiple threads created from same Object share object
// variables and this can lead to data inconsistency when the threads
// are used to read and update the shared data.

//In above program for loop, count is incremented by 1 four times and since
// we have two threads, itâ€™s value should be 8 after both the threads
// finished executing. But when you will run above program multiple times,
// you will notice that count value is varying between 6,7,8. This is
// happening because even if count++ seems to be an atomic operation,
// its NOT and causing data corruption.


//Thread safety is the process to make our program safe to use in
// multithreaded environment, there are different ways through
// which we can make our program thread safe.

//Synchronization is the easiest and most widely used tool for thread
// safety in java.

//        Use of Atomic Wrapper classes from java.util.concurrent.atomic
// package. For example AtomicInteger

//        Use of locks from java.util.concurrent.locks package.
//        Using thread safe collection classes, check this post
// for usage of ConcurrentHashMap for thread safety.

//        Using volatile keyword with variables to make every thread
// read the data from memory, not read from thread cache.
