//When a thread calls an object's synchronized method, the whole object is locked.
//This means that if another thread tries to call any synchronized method of the same
// object, the call will block until the lock is released (which happens when the
// original call finishes). In general, if the value of a field of an object can be
// changed, then all methods that read or write that field should be synchronized to
// prevent two threads from trying to write the field at the same time, and to prevent
// one thread from reading the field while another thread is in the process of writing it.
