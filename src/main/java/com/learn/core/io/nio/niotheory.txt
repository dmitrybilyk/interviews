In the standard IO API you work with byte streams and character streams.
In NIO you work with channels and buffers. Data is always read from a channel
into a buffer, or written from a buffer to a channel.

Java NIO contains the concept of "selectors". A selector is an object that can
monitor multiple channels for events (like: connection opened, data arrived etc.).
Thus, a single thread can monitor multiple channels for data.

How all this works is explained in more detail in the next text in this series -
the Java NIO overview.
