Preconditions are not new. Apache Commons had similar functionality but not as clean as Guava’s solution.
Preconditions are used for checking method arguments, states, etc. When a condition is false the Precondition
will throw the expected exception. With expected I mean the following: when checking a state you can use
Preconditions.checkState( condition ). If the condition is false it will throw an IllegalStateException.
The same is true for other Preconditions like checkArgument which throws an IllegalArgumentException.
Of course, working with Preconditions only makes sense when using static Imports. Let’s take a look at
an example.
