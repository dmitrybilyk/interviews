Either one would work. It depends on your needs:
If your bean identifier contains special character(s) for example (/viewSummary.html),
it wont be allowed as the bean id, because it's not a valid XML ID. In such cases you could skip defining
the bean id and supply the bean name instead.
The name attribute also helps in defining aliases for your bean, since it allows specifying multiple
identifiers for a given bean.


 @Required annotation
 is used in bean at setter level. Once @Required is applied on a property then it is necessary to assign value for that property.
 It should be initialized at configuration level. The container will throw error if we do not configure valued for @Required
 property. At setter method of the property of the bean, put the @Required annotation.

 @Resource vs @Autowired
Both, without specifying any attributes of the annotation, perform injection by type. The difference is:
    @Resource allows you to specify a name of the injected bean
    @Autowired allows you to mark it as non-mandatory.
