'Dependency injection' means giving an object its instance variables. Dependency injection
is basically providing the objects that and object needs (it's dependencies) instead
of having it construct them itself. It's also very useful for testing.
Dependencies can be injected into objects by many means(Constructor injection
Setter injection).

Dependency Injection was originally called Inversion of Control (IoC) because the normal
control sequence would be the object finds the objects it depends on by itself and then
calls them. Here, this is reversed: The dependencies are handed to the object when it's
created. This also illustrates the Hollywood Principle at work: Don't call around for
your dependencies, we'll give them to you when we need you.

Inversion of control devides WHAT to do from WHEN to do.
