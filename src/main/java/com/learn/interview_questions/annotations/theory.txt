Annotations are used to provide supplement information about a program.

Annotations start with ‘@’.
Annotations do not change action of a compiled program.
Annotations help to associate metadata (information) to the program elements i.e. instance variables, constructors,
methods, classes, etc.
Annotations are not pure comments as they can change the way a program is treated by compiler. See below code for example.

We can create our custom annotation and then check by means of reflection if
it is present. And we can run some logic if it's present.
we point @Target annotation in order to say where annotation could be situated.
Also we use @Retention to say, if we want that annotation to be present at runtime (in class) or
at compile time only.
