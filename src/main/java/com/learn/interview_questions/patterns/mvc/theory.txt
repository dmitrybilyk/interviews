MVC pattern stands for Model - View - Controller. View sends request to Controller based on mapping and
Controller determines to which Business Model behavior to delegate the request. Model performs all operations, fetches
some result and sends to Controller which passes Data model (ideally just some pojo without behavior) to View.
So, View knows about Data Model to be able to show it properly. Controller knows about both View and Model.
Model doesn't know about anybody. In MVC View and Model could be easily replaced. That's the main idea of this pattern.
