Java memory consists of Stack and Heap. Both occupy the RAM.

Stack is quicker and memory allocation happens at
compile time. Stack persist methods and local variables, references to objects. It frees up quickly at once method
is over.

Heap keeps global objects. Memory allocation happens at runtime. It's unlimited in size. It consists of
Young and Old generation. Garbage collector frees up young generation at once. But in old generation there is some
more complicated algorithm.


Reference types:
Strong - usual. When there no any reference to the object (when it's set to null for instance) the object is deleted
from memory.
WeakReference - good to load the link to classloader. GC will remove objects if just weak reference are connected to it.
SoftReference - garbage collection will remove objects if there is a lack of memory (good for implementing cache).
PhantomReference - helpful if we just want to know if object is will be removed now and memory will be allocated.
