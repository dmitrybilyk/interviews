//Memento pattern is implemented with two objects – Originator and Caretaker.
// Originator is the object whose state needs to be saved and restored and
// it uses an inner class to save the state of Object. The inner class is
// called Memento and its private, so that it can’t be accessed from other
// objects.
//    Caretaker is the helper class that is responsible for storing and
// restoring the Originator’s state through Memento object. Since Memento
// is private to Originator, Caretaker can’t access it and it’s stored as
// an Object within the caretaker.
