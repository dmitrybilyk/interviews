//Behaviour depends on the internal state of the object itself.
//The benefits of using State pattern to implement polymorphic behavior is
// clearly visible, the chances of error are less and itâ€™s very easy to
// add more states for additional behavior making it more robust, easily
// maintainable and flexible. Also State pattern helped in avoiding if-else
// or switch-case conditional logic in this scenario.
